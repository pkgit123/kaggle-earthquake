# Kaggle Earthquake Competition
Exploring the Kaggle Earthquake Competition in Feb 2019.  I'm not planning to actually compete, but just familiarizing myself with the Kaggle Kernels (Jupyter Notebooks) and the kaggle-api command line interface. Based on some of the kernels I reviewed, noticed scikit-learn has some new libraries. Refreshing machine learning skills, most of my prior ML experience was during my master's degree.  

Tasks:
* Familiarize myself with Kaggle API (command line tool), use to download datasets.
* Unzip the datasets into folder.
* Move downloaded data into archive_folder to make it easier to follow.
* Update .gitignore file so not uploading huge datasets into github
* Read some public kernels and experiment with code in Juypyter Notebook.
